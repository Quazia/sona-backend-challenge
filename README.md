## Generate SSL certificates

1.  Generate an RSA private key, of size 2048, and output it to a file named key.pem:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
```

```bash
# It needs be copied&pasted from terminal manually
awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf"%s\\n",$0;}' private_key.pem
```

2.  Extract the public key from the key pair, which can be used in a certificate:

```bash
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public_key.pem
```

```bash
# It needs be copied&pasted from terminal manually
awk 'NF {sub(/\r/, ""); printf "%s\\n",$0;}' public_key.pem
```
